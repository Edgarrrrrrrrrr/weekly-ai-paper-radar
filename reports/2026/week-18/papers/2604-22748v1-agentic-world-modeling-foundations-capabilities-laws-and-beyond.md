## 为什么值得看

这是当前阶段值得跟踪的新工作，适合拿来观察研究重心是否正在发生迁移。

## 核心方法 / 关键贡献

As AI systems move from generating text to accomplishing goals through sustained interaction, the ability to model environment dynamics becomes a central bottleneck. Agents that manipulate objects, navigate software, coordinate with others, or design experiments require predictive environment models, yet the term world model carries different meanings across research communities. We introduce a "levels x laws" taxonomy organized along two axes. The first defines three capability levels: L1 Predictor, which learns one-step local transition operators; L2 Simulator, which composes them into multi-step, action-conditioned rollouts that respect domain laws; and L3 Evolver, which autonomously revises its own model when predictions fail against new evidence. The second identifies four governing-law regimes: physical, digital, social, and scientific. These regimes determine what constraints a world model must satisfy and where it is most likely to fail. Using this framework, we synthesize over 400 works and summarize more than 100 representative systems spanning model-based reinforcement learning, video generation, web and GUI agents, multi-agent social simulation, and AI-driven scientific discovery. We analyze methods, failure modes, and evaluation practices across level-regime pairs, propose decision-centric evaluation principles and a minimal reproducible evaluation package, and outline architectural guidance, open problems, and governance challenges. The resulting roadmap connects previously isolated communities and charts a path from passive next-step prediction toward world models that can simulate, and ultimately reshape, the environments in which agents operate.

## 技术要点

- 建议先把这篇放回整个方向脉络里看，而不是孤立地看一篇论文。
- 如果你在做路线判断，比起单个指标，更要看它重新定义了什么任务边界。
- 真正的价值通常体现在是否改变了后续研究的默认范式。

## 应用价值

- 适合作为近期方向判断和技术情报输入。
- 适合帮助你发现哪些问题开始被研究社区反复强调。

## 风险与局限

- 当前分析基于论文摘要或配置中的方向摘记，不等价于完整精读。
- 真正的工程价值仍然需要结合实验设计、复现难度和系统成本来判断。

## 推荐谁读

- 需要做方向判断的研究负责人
- 在做生成式产品或 Agent 产品路线规划的人
- 需要追踪交叉方向机会的多模态团队

## 建议继续追问的问题

- 和同方向过去 4 到 8 周的工作做横向比较。
- 重点看实验设置、任务定义和是否真的解决了生产可用性问题。

As AI systems move from generating text to accomplishing goals through sustained interaction, the ability to model environment dynamics becomes a central bottleneck. Agents that manipulate objects, navigate software, coordinate with others, or design experiments require predictive environment models, yet the term world model carries different meanings across research communities. We introduce a "levels x laws" taxonomy organized along two axes. The first defines three capability levels: L1 Predictor, which learns one-step local transition operators; L2 Simulator, which composes them into multi-step, action-conditioned rollouts that respect domain laws; and L3 Evolver, which autonomously revises its own model when predictions fail against new evidence. The second identifies four governing-law regimes: physical, digital, social, and scientific. These regimes determine what constraints a world model must satisfy and where it is most likely to fail. Using this framework, we synthesize over 400 works and summarize more than 100 representative systems spanning model-based reinforcement learning, video generation, web and GUI agents, multi-agent social simulation, and AI-driven scientific discovery. We analyze methods, failure modes, and evaluation practices across level-regime pairs, propose decision-centric evaluation principles and a minimal reproducible evaluation package, and outline architectural guidance, open problems, and governance challenges.

## 为什么值得看

这是当前阶段值得跟踪的新工作，适合拿来观察研究重心是否正在发生迁移。

## 核心方法 / 关键贡献

This paper integrates end-to-end Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models with agentic tool-use to propose Agentic Robot with Tool-use (ART). ART is a tool-injection framework that tunes any VLA model to leverage off-the-shelf tool modules for low-level vision, high-level affordance, and embodiment enhancement. Compared to vanilla VLA models with a whole continuous action solution space, ART reduces the complexity of the action solution space through tool-use, which not only improves generalizability across different tasks but also reduces data dependency. To demonstrate the advantages (high generalizability and low data dependency) of this framework, we first built a dataset of 30K tool-use trajectories and action demonstrations, which is much smaller than those used by baseline methods. We then designed a training regimen for long-trajectory tool-use reasoning in challenging environments. Experiments show that ART achieves a 20% higher success rate than mainstream baselines on simulation and real-world tasks, such as pick-and-place in the dark at novel viewpoints. Empirical results highlight the benefits of an agent-based approach: modular tool utilization enables more efficient training, lightweight deployment, and scalable integration of new tools. This design fosters robustness, adaptability, and extensibility, paving the way for the practical deployment of VLA systems in complex real-world scenarios.

## 技术要点

- 建议先把这篇放回整个方向脉络里看，而不是孤立地看一篇论文。
- 如果你在做路线判断，比起单个指标，更要看它重新定义了什么任务边界。
- 真正的价值通常体现在是否改变了后续研究的默认范式。

## 应用价值

- 适合作为近期方向判断和技术情报输入。
- 适合帮助你发现哪些问题开始被研究社区反复强调。

## 风险与局限

- 当前分析基于论文摘要或配置中的方向摘记，不等价于完整精读。
- 真正的工程价值仍然需要结合实验设计、复现难度和系统成本来判断。

## 推荐谁读

- 需要做方向判断的研究负责人
- 在做生成式产品或 Agent 产品路线规划的人
- 需要追踪交叉方向机会的多模态团队

## 建议继续追问的问题

- 和同方向过去 4 到 8 周的工作做横向比较。
- 重点看实验设置、任务定义和是否真的解决了生产可用性问题。
